The name should always be in full as Fort Bend LINC. "LINC" is pronounced "link".

Copy should meet the goals described in the brief:

1. Welcoming
2. Reassuring
3. Inclusive
4. Accessible

Opt for:

* Simple sentences as opposed to compound sentences
* Everyday vocabulary
* Optimistic
* Active tense vs passive tense

Imagery should also follow in this tone.
