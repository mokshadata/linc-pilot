In the future, Fort Bend LINC will be expanding its access and program. At that time, branding will need to be updated and adapted for:

1. Expanded, general audience
  * New clients may be hearing about the program from word-of-mouth, outreach, marketing.
  * Clients may need more explanation of assistance programs
  * Clients may need more reassurance for assistance
2. Expanded programs
  * Each program should get a differentiated icon or branding variation

Updates will be made as goals change.
